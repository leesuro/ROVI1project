\chapter{Correcting box position} % (fold)
\label{chap:1}
There are two ways to move elements in the robwork's scene:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Online change. Once the scene has been loaded, all the elements can be moved from the RobWork Studio. However all the changes are not permanent while the scene is not saved.
	\item File change. The changes are made directly in the scene (the $Scene.wc.xml$ given). In this case, in the $Pallet's$ frame, 11 cm should be introduced in the Y axis writing $<Pos> 0 0.11 0 </Pos>$.
\end{itemize}

Due to the permanency of the changes the second method has been used for this case.
