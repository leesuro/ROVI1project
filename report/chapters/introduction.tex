\section{Overall description}
Nowadays in the various areas of industry, the Robotic vison systems are becoming more and more widespread. There is a big variety of environments where the systems are being applied. The systems are built up for different purposes, for which exist various solution methods. 

The goal of this project is to create a RobWork Studio plugin for camera servoing. To achieve this goal robotics - inverse kinematics and Computer Vision - marker detection methods have been combined together. 

This project describes various approaches used to detect different markers in different environments and inverse kinematics applied on a robotic arm with a mounted camera to follow the moving marker. 

\subsection{Report structure}
The report is organized so it starts with analysis and description of implemented methods in Robotics (inverse kinematics) and Computer Vision (markers detection) parts. Then the report continues by explaining the combining of these two sub parts, performed measurements and achieved results.
