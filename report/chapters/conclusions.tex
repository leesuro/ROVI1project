\label{chap:conclusions}
A complete implementation for a visual servoing has been presented. First, the feature extraction has been implemented for all the markers given and, despite the lines method needs to be improved, the color and the corny markers have given good results being possible to combine this method within the RobWork plug-in.

Second, the inverse kinematics method presented in the book has been implemented successfully giving experimental results that we consider as good inside of the learning frame of the course. The basic concepts of the inverse kinematics and tracking have been acquired.

Lastly, the combining part has result good based on the experiments. We consider them good results because, despite the errors and the tracking can be generally improved the robot has shown able to track the markers in all the cases and with no lost. However the implementation of the three point tracking is marked as a future work.
